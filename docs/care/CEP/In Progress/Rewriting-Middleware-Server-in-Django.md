# Rewriting Middleware Server in Django

## Update Observations

#### Requirements/Motive 

The current Implementation of the middleware is such that we store the same observation data in different variables in different data structures for different scenarios 
for example 

```javascript 
export var staticObservations: StaticObservation[] = [];
var activeDevices: string[] = [];
var lastRequestData = {};
var logData: {
  dateTime: string;
  data: Observation[][];
}[] = [];
var statusData: ObservationStatus[] = [];
var lastObservationData: LastObservationData = {};
let observationData: { time: Date; data: Observation[][] }[] = [];
```

The structure of others defined here are  as follows 

```javascript 

export interface StaticObservation {
  device_id: string;
  observations: Record<ObservationType, Observation[]>;
  last_updated: Date;
}

export type LastObservationData = {
  [observation_id in ObservationTypeWithWaveformTypes]?: {
    [device_id: string]: Observation;
  };
}

export interface ObservationStatus {
  time: string;
  status: {
    [device_id: string]: "up" | "down";
  };
}

```
We need to come up with an efficient solution so that we do not store redundant data and can populate the required data as and when required.

### Usages 
#### staticObservations
  - Structure - Static observation is a list of type StaticObservation
    ``` javascript 
      export interface StaticObservation {
        device_id: string;
        observations: Record<ObservationType, Observation[]>;
        last_updated: Date;
            }

      export var staticObservations: StaticObservation[] = [];
      ```
  - how is it populated
    - we update ```staticObservations``` when we get the cns data
    - we update the array related to the  observation type and in the array we just keep the last n number of data (n = DEFAULT_LISTING_LIMIT) and append the latest observation to it .
    - we update  ```last_updated``` value when we update any of the observation type related to the device id.
    - we also do check if the device id is in active devices but we don't really use this value which is a redundant check as we do not remove any device from active devices.
  
  - where is it used?
    - ```/get_observations``` endpoint where we return the observations related to the device id passed in the request
    - Automated daily rounds 
      - here we just fetch all the observations related to a particular device id 

#### activeDevices
  - Structure - active devices is just a list of strings
    ``` javascript 
      var activeDevices: string[] = [];
      ```
  - how is it populated
    - we update ```activeDevices``` when we get the cns data.
    - we just put the device_id when we get the cns data.
  - where is it used?
    - the actual data in ```activeDevices``` is not used as such we just use it as a check while updating static observations but regardless of the check we do add the observation in ```staticObservations```.


#### lastRequestData
  - Structure 
    ``` javascript 
    var lastRequestData = {};
    ```
    - how is it populated 
      -  we populate it with just assigning the latest data every time we receive it from cns as it is without any flattening or calculations.
    - where is it used?
      - ```/get_last_request_data``` endpoint where we just return ```lastRequestData``` as it is.

#### lastObservationData
  - Structure
    ```javascript
    export type LastObservationData = {
      [observation_id in ObservationTypeWithWaveformTypes]?: {
        [device_id: string]: Observation;
      };
    };
    var lastObservationData: LastObservationData = {};
    ```
    - how is it populated 
      - we update it when we get the cns data.
      -  we populate it when ```observation.value, observation.data``` is present  and ``` observation.status === final ```
    - where is it used?
      - in ```updateLastObservationData``` we just use ```lastObservationData["blood-pressure"]``` other then this we don't use this data anywhere.


#### logData 
  - Structure 
     ```javascript 
        var logData: {
          dateTime: string;
          data: Observation[][];
        }[] = [];
      ```
    - how is it populated 
      - we update ```logData``` every time we get the cns data
      - we just keep the last n entries  (n = DEFAULT_LISTING_LIMIT) 
      - we add current timestamp to the received data and push it to the log data 
    - where is it used?
      - in  ```/get_log_data``` endpoint we return logData as it is. 

#### statusData 
  - structure 
    ``` javascript 

    export interface ObservationStatus {
      time: string;
      status: {
        [device_id: string]: "up" | "down";
      };
    }

    var statusData: ObservationStatus[] = [];
    ```
  - how is it populated  
    - we update it every time we get the cns data
    - we create a status type object from the data and we truncate the minutes and seconds from it.
    - if the next data arrives in the same minute we just replace it with the current one else we push a new entry in the array.
    - and we only consider data for the last 30 mins 
  - where is it used?
      - in  ```/devices/status``` endpoint where we return the status data of last 30 mins 
#### observationData 
  - structure 
    ``` javascript 
    export let observationData: { time: Date; data: Observation[][] }[] = [];
    ```
  - how is it populated  
    - its same as we populate log data i.e add timestamp to the received data from cns and then push it to an array
    - even the structure for log data and observationData is same 
  - where is it used?
    - it is used in ```getVitalsFromObservationsForAccuracy``` and ```observationsS3Dump``` 

### latestObservation
  - structure
    ``` javascript 
    #observations: Record<string, any> = {};
    ``` 
    
  - how is it populated  
    - we set the latest data for each device
  - where is it used?
    - it is used in an endpoint getLatestVitals other than that we do not use it.

### Problem 
  we store the same data in different/similar formats which can be reduced so that the data is stored efficiently and we can populate the data based on requirement 

### Implementation
  - Observations 
    - we need some sort of data structure which can be used here so that any data which is required can be calculated on the go.
    - we can also delegate the task of storing the variables to redis instead of storing it in django's memory.
    - active devices list is not needed.
    - logData and observationData are exactly the same.
    - if we can just store the previous values for blood pressure per device then we can completely remove the usage of ```lastObservationData``` as its only used for ```blood-pressure```
    - we can remove latestObservation as it is not used for anything that cant be calculated
    - the function updateLastObservationData can be removed as we are not using lastObservationData
    - for status api we just need the status of each device for past minute
    - in automated daily rounds we need data related to last one hour 
    - As we just need last one hour data for automated daily rounds we can dump the rest of the data
    - we do not have to store static observations  as it is used in automated daily rounds only we can just calculate it when needed

  - Solution 
    - optimization for updateObservations
      - we store the observations as it is on redis, we will just flatten it into a list
      - while getting the data to middleware we add a new field to all the observations taken_at which is the current time so we do not have to add current time separately
      - we will not store static observations separately, we will calculate it during automated daily rounds
      - we we will make a local variable for blood pressure which will be of type dict to store the last blood pressure value for a particular device
      ``` python 
      blood_pressure_data: Dict[DeviceID, Observation] = {}
      ```
    - optimizations for automated daily rounds
      - in static observations we now call a function which will generate the static observations for us
      - it will get the observations and then return only those observations which are within the required time frame (1 hour) and also belongs to a particular device

  - further optimizations 
    - pydantic
      - we have use pydantic models instead of serializers
      - it has helped us reduce a lot of code  refer https://github.com/coronasafe/teleicu_middleware_backend/pull/1/commits/e6eb7247baf0d5af1aad47a7da570d2cc54c07eb
      - we can also use pydantic classes for typing 
        - due to this we can use observations with properties instead of dicts
      - can create aliases to parse and serialize specific fields
    - Re-writing observations class
